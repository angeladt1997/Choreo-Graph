            After logging in, users will be directed to the dashboard. On first login, 
            the user will have to GET their data for pieces from the database. 
            After the first login, the users screen will begin it's default functions.
            The idea is for the first video listed in current pieces to begin playing on 
            the iframe component of the page, in the default mode "theater view".
            The pieces will come from a database. Current pieces, upcoming performances,
            and past pieces will be listed in a side accordion component. Each piece they 
            click on can be opened in studio view (by clicking view in studio). Uses are 
            able to log out from here (where they will be taken back to the login form).
            Users can send messages to creators by clicking contact creator, which will
            link users to the inMail page.
