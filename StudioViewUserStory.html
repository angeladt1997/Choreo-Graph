           Users will be navigated here after they click on view in studio. 
           Unlike dashboard, the iframe element on this page will be empty to
           start. User will be able to toggle how they are viewing the piece,
           how they are seeing the piece (full phrases or broken down phrases),
           and will be able to learn stage directions to view entrances and exits.
           Users will also be able to toggle what they see on screen when it comes
           to other performers. They can contact the creator from here, log out,
           or choose to view the piece on their dashboard (theater view).
