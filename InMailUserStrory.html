           After clicking "Contact Creator", user will be directed to this page.
           User will be able to send messages to creators from a drop down. They will
           then be able to submit that message within the Chore-Graph app. Users can also
           view archived messages, return to other areas of the app, or log out to be
           redirected to the log in screen.
