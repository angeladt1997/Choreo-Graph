          From the dashboard, users will be able to click on Stage Select, which will
          allow users to choose the stage they are working on. There will be a select drop 
          down that allow users to choose a stage based on their studio affiliation (down the 
          line, these dimensions and designs will be loaded to the select menu using that info).
          This will automatically add the shape of the stage to the screen, and will load place-
          holders on the screen as if the user is seeing a piece they are in. Then, they will
          be able to click or un-click buttons to make the x's appear or disappear. Eventually,
          this component will be a part of studio and dashboard, but for the purpose of flushing
          it out for capstone, it will be its own component.
