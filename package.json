  "description": "The beginning foundations of the software designed for choreographers by a choreographer\r Choreo-Graph is a work in process! It's design is the answer to a question that Angela has been asking for years- How can I express my love for movement and its creation when I do not have dancers or a studio? Or, how can dancers and other on stage performers understand an artist's concept when they have never seen it? The goal of Choreo-Graph is to allow choreographers to have movements, phrases, and stage settings all in one place to design full pieces without dancers present. I have multiple journals of written choreography that I would like to bring to life, and I see this as a stepping stone to do, while also improving the tools available to other creating artists.",
